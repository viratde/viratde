# 👋 Hello, I'm Virat Kumar!

I'm a self-taught **Android Developer** with over 2 years of experience in mobile app development, specializing in **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and multi-module architecture. Currently, I’m focused on Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and building scalable, efficient Android apps. I'm also diving into **Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)** to contribute to open-source projects like AndroidX and enhance my tooling skills.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- **Task Manager App** – a robust app with position-based task assignments, scheduling, and event management.
- **Mutual Fund SIP App** – a fintech project for seamless mutual fund investments in India, integrating with AMC aggregators.
- **Custom Gradle Plugins** – creating plugins for streamlined dependency and build management.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Use

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Coroutines
- **Architecture:** MVVM, Clean Architecture, Multi-module setup, Dependency Injection
- **Testing & Mocking:** Ktor MockEngine, UI Automator, Unit & Instrumented Testing
- **Tooling:** Gradle, KSP, OpenJDK 8

## 🌱 Open-Source Goals

My goal is to contribute to **AndroidX**, **Kotlin Coroutines**, and **Kotlin Multiplatform** libraries. I’m currently exploring the internals of **KSP**, aiming to contribute to its `compiler-plugin` module and gain a deeper understanding of compiler tooling.
