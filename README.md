# 👋 Hello, I'm Virat Kumar!

I'm a self-taught **Android Developer** with over 2 years of experience in mobile app development, specializing in **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and multi-module architecture. Currently, I’m focused on Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and building scalable, efficient Android apps. I'm also diving into **Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)** to contribute to open-source projects like AndroidX and enhance my tooling skills.
